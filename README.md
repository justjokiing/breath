# Breath Icon Theme

This theme used to be available for Manjaro distributions during KDE 5 but has not been updated for it since. It only edits three files (the svgs in the root), but gives a bit more tailored Manjaro experience for KDE 6 users.

## Installation

1. `cd ~/.local/share/icons`
2. `git clone https://github.com/justjokiing/breath`
3. Navigate to System Settings > Colors & Themes > Icons
4. Select "Breath" and click apply.

You should now notice that your KDE start menu is now the Manjaro Icon, which changes color based on your Accent Color.
If you have pamac update notifications, you will that system tray icon should be changed as well. It will show an indicator when updates are available, which also changes color based on the Accent Color attribute.
